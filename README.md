# Post Notification

Post Notification plugin for Wordpress by various authors. See https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-notification/

## Description

It's an old plugin, but it still works. It's a bit of a pain to set up, but it's the only plugin I've found that does what I need it to do. I use it to send out new posts to my subscribers. It's not perfect, but it's the best I've found.
As part of our ongoing commitment to improving the WordPress framework, we regularly identify and phase out deprecated functions. These are typically functions that have become obsolete due to improvements and changes in newer versions of WordPress. Using deprecated functions can lead to security risks and degrade the performance of your website. Therefore, we strongly recommend developers to periodically review their code and replace any deprecated functions with their latest counterparts to ensure optimal security, performance, and compatibility with the latest version of WordPress
Only small changes are made to the plugin to keep it working with the latest version of Wordpress.
The plugin is not actively maintained, but it still works.
