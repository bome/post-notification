optionally notify an admin (enter email addresses in backend) on every subscription attempt.

Prevent authentication emails sent when bots enter an email address in a Subscribe field. using JavaScript, add another field when subscribing non-logged in users.

Refactor: remove all ?> at the end of php files.

Use standard Wordpress forms for subscribing, so that it's easier to secure the subscription process.

Change http accesses in such a way that you can easily create a fail2ban rule for detecting abuse. Most importantly, to catch repeated subscribing, without an account, of different email addresses (max. 4 attempts) or of the same email address (max 10 attempts if captcha enabled, 3 attempts if not). For example, by specifying the operation (sent_activation_email) and the email address as URL parameters.

Refactor: replace @@shortcodes with [shortcode]. Will, hopefully, allow to remove the expensive filter for “the_content”. Will require an update of all pages that use @@ shortcodes, and the post notification templates.
